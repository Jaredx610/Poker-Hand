# Poker-Hand
Java program that reads a hand of cards from an input file and calculates the total amount of points of those cards and if it is a valid hand.
## Getting Started

The first thing the user needs to do is create a data file named p1.dat for the program to use. The format of the file should follow the following example:
  #$ #$ #$ #$ and so on
      # = rank of the card (1-10, A for Ace, J for Jack, Q for Queen, K for King)
      $ = suit of the card (C for clubs, D for diamonds, H for hearts, S for spades)
